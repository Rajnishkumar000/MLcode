Multicollinearity is a statistical phenomenon that occurs when two or more independent variables in a regression model
are highly correlated with each other, indicating a strong linear relationship among the predictor variables.0
This can lead to skewed or misleading results when a researcher or analyst attempts to determine how well each independent
variable can be used most effectively to predict or understand the dependent variable in a statistical model.2 If the degree of correlation
between variables is high enough, it can cause problems when fitting the model and interpreting the results.3
Multicollinearity can wreak havoc on the analysis and limit the research conclusions we can draw
