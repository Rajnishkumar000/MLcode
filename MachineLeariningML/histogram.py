# Histogram shows the count of the value for the no of range

##Z SCORE
# u-2sigma u-sigma u u+sigma u+2sigma it is gaussian normal distribution

# and for standard normal distribution
# sigma=1 and u=0

# u-sigma to u+sigma ->68%
# u-3sigma to u+s3igma ->99.7%

# To convert gaussian to standar normal distribution
# z-score=xi-u/sigma

## FOR GREATER THAN 60 WE DO
# (60-75)/SIGNMA

# HERE SIGMA=10
# 75 IS MEAN
