Bias->Bias means the distance between predicted value and actual(target value)
      high bias means high gap between predicted value and actual(target value)
      low bias neans low gap between predicted value and actual(target value)

variance->It refers to how much point in prediction is scattered
           high variance means they are scattered too much
           low variance means the exist closer


Before diving into to Ridge we have to know about Regularization

focus on highest  Regression coeffcient
but we need high computational power to perform calculation for the higher value
so we need to do something to reduce the computation
so to shrink the magnitude or to scale down of Regression coefficient we have to use REGULARIZATION

Therefore we have 2 ways to perfome Regularization
1>Ridge Regression
2>Lasso Regression

                                      Ridge
                                     -------

Ridge=Loss + Penalty
Cost Function = Loss + alpha*||w||^2

loss=difference between actual and predicted
penalty=Alpha(||w||)^2
TO compensate loss we add Penalty
and the other advantage of adding penalty is to shrinks the magnitude
as the value of alpha increases then coefficient of magnitude decreases

                                       Lasso
                                     _________

Lasso=Loss + alpha * ||w||
it eleminates the less effective coloumn but in case of ridge the coloumn's magnitude was lessen not zero
that is in case of lasso manitude can reach zero
it reduces complexity as well as features
